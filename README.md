# VSCode Custom Keybindings Configuration

**DOESN'T WORK WITH WINDOWS** and Linux. But we hate Windows. I will probably make it support Linux at some point. But Windows - nope.

## CHEATSHEET

`<leader> = space`

| Command           | Key                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| `Shift + k`       | Display Info              |
| `Cmd + backspace` | Toggle Sidebar Visibility |
| `<leader> + d`    | Go To Definition          |
| `<leader> + r`    | Show References           |

TODO:

- [ ] - Add git commands (blame, diff)
- [ ] - Research whether you can navigate hover displays using vim motions (easily copy typescript errors)
- [ ] - bind vim copy buffer in vscode to machine's clipboard
